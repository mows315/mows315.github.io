            <p class="question">2. In your own words, explain what Git and Github are used for and the main
                differences between them.</p>
            <div class="answer">
              
The main difference between Git and Github is the fact that while Git is typically considered a software, Github is considered a service.
For instance, Git is a software used to manage and keep track of your source code and its history, while Github is an online service which
individuals can use to upload, connect, and host their code to the cloud based service.
