<p>The subject matter from the text In Praise of Shadows by Jun'ichiro Tanizaki focuses on delving within the history and meaning behind the use of shadows and darkness in Japanese architecture. This text emphasizes the differences behind the use of architecture used in the west, such as in the way of how the west typically constructs structures with a focus on bringing in light, with the complete opposite in Japan. Additionally, this text brings out a significant amount of imagery when talking about the how Japanese architecture focuses on emphasizing shadows within a home. For instance, readers are able to vividly comprehend the darkness, shadows, and detail of a room in a typical Japanese house from reading this story, as well as imagine the tiniest shed of light that shines in a room of darkness towards a piece of gold. This leads to viewers becoming vastly interested in the meaning of the choices in architecture  of typical Japanese homes. Overall, this text is very sparse, descriptive, and visual in the story and context that it describes.

Of all my findings, what I want to point out to the reader about this text in my designed interpretation is the immense depth, emotions, and connotations that shadows can provide which are not typically associated with in its meaning. Thus, to achieve this goal I plan on arranging imagery and text in a way to accentuate the strong connotations of shadows and darkness. This may include utilizing additional contents such as video, sound, and more.
