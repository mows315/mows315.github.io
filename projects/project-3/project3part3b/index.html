        <li>My assigned collections revolves around the content of Japanese typography that are present during the time period of 2009 within the publication Hobby Japan 8.
        </li>
        <li>The context of the collection is to demonstrate the use of typography and stylistic choices that were made within the country of Japan during the time period of 2009.
        </li>
        <li>The content within the collection shows Japanese typography. Additionally, the content is surrounded by different colors and backgrounds, and the contents are cropped within a taken photo.
        </li>
        <li>The quality of the image is good. They are created by utilizing a photo to take a picture of the Japanese typography from the book.
        </li>
        <li>The Japanese typography comes from the physical book of Hobby Japan 8 in the 2009 publication. While the original artists are not directly credited within the book, the contents of this collection come from a variety of different sources and companies that are present within the book.
        </li>
        <li>The material of the collection is photographed and cropped in a way to display only the typography as a whole. The cropping style may resemble a very hands-on, scrapbook, authentic, retro-like feel.
